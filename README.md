Hereâ€™s a revised version of the `.md` file with a description for an eCommerce store:

# eCommerce Store Setup

This project is a fully functional eCommerce store built using Next.js. It provides a seamless shopping experience, allowing users to browse products, add them to their cart, and proceed with checkout. The backend API handles product data, orders, and user authentication, while the frontend delivers a smooth, user-friendly interface. The application is designed to be fast and responsive, optimized for performance and user experience.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the eCommerce store locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory (if it doesn't exist already) and define your environment variables. You will need to add the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` variable to connect to the backend API.

Example `.env.local` file:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-api-url.com
```

This variable will be used to make API calls to the backend for fetching products, processing orders, and other store-related functionalities.

### 4. Run the Development Server

Once the environment variables are set up, you can start the development server by running:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

This will launch the eCommerce store locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 5. Access the Store

Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view and interact with the eCommerce store.

### Example `.env.local` File:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-api-url.com
```

This setup ensures that your API URL is safely handled, while also exposing it to the frontend for API calls.
